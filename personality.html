            <h2>Strong Trait: Self Confident</h2>
            <p>As a dedicated network engineer, having self-confidence has been crucial to my success throughout my college life. I recall late-night study sessions where I used my problem-solving abilities to decipher complex group assessments. My love for reading aswell as coding along with my confidence in my own abilities, kept me upbeat and focused during group projects. It has allowed me to take on leadership roles, ensuring that group stayed on track and met deadlines. My self Confidence also propelled me to communicate my ideas clearly and persuasively, which made working with peers a breeze. In the end, It has not only helped me achieve academic success but also helped me build a network of friends and mentors who share my enthusiasm for technology and innovation. </p>

            <h2>My Motto</h2>
            <p>"If you have no confidence in self you are twice defeated in the race of life. With confidence you have won even before you have started". 
                Self-reliance. 
                This famous inspiring quote by The honourable Marcus Mosiah Garvey has taught me how valueable one must possess the quality of self-confidence, as it can change not only my life but others lives aswell. Setbacks are more likely to occur if we don't believe in ourselves. Having self confidence provides an advantage and opens doors for success.</p>
