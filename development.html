            <h2>Summary of The Twelve Pillars: Chapter 4-7</h2>
        <main></main>
            </p>Setting goals and to value personal development are topics covered in  chapter 4, which according to Charlie, goals help people focus on their life's objectives by providing them with direction and meaning. Chapter 5 emphasizes that there are many opportunities in our every day lives, but there is only one major opportunity. Charlie advises Michael to develop a self-educational practice as it is crucial for long-term success and personal development. This means that we should focus on the chances that best suit our goals. Make the most of the day rather than wasting it on tasks that are not as vital but focus more on ones that are urgent. Chapter 6 speaks about the people we surround ourselves with in our day today lives who somewhat influences us significantly. Mr. Davis advises that we should always ask ourselves: Who are these individual and what contribution do they add to lives whether positive or negative, so that we can make a correct discussion whether to keep them in ourlives or not. Chapter 7 discusses the value of self-education, this means learning on our own or self taught. In order to continuously develop and improve, we must learn new things along our journey to increase not only only our knowledge but increase our vocabular as knowledge is power without knowledge we are like a tree without roots.

            <h2>Reflection of the Twelve Pillars</h2>
            <main></main>
            </p>Chapter 4 has taught me the importance of creating goals, developing objectives, and value personal improvement. Chapter 5 also reminded me that it's crucial to focus on one significant opportunity in my daily life rather than on unimportant ones. I discovered in Chapter 6 the influenceÂ of the people in my life and the need to assess myself in order to measure their impact.  Finally, I learned from Chapter 7 that obtaining a solid education may broaden my knowledge, which will help me succeed in both my personal and professional life in the long run.</p>

            </p>I will begin by establishing clear, measurable goals that are consistent with my beliefs and ambitions, making sure to concentrate on my own development. I'll pick out and rank one major an opportunity per day that can help me advance while avoiding distractions. I will routinely evaluate my relationships to see how they affect my development and look for uplifting influences.
